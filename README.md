# Kundali by Krish

Welcome to the **Kundali by Krish** project! This is a simple, fully front-end website designed to help you analyze a basic Jyotish Kundali (natal chart). It's a tool for personal use and for anyone interested in basic astrological analysis based on traditional principles.

## Features

-   **Manual Data Entry**: You can manually input the position of planets (Grahas) in different houses (Rashis).
-   **Kundali Visualization**: The website visually represents the Kundali chart based on your input.
-   **Automated Analysis**: The tool analyzes the chart and provides a detailed report based on pre-fed Jyotish rules, including:
    -   Planetary status (exaltation, debilitation, own house)
    -   Planetary relationships (friends, enemies, neutral)
    -   Planetary aspects (Drishti)

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Planet**: Use the dropdown menu to choose a planet (e.g., Surya, Mangal, Guru).
2.  **Select a Rashi (House)**: Choose the house number (1-12) where the planet is located.
3.  **Add Planet**: Click the "Add Planet" button to place the planet on the chart.
4.  **Analyze**: Once you have placed all the desired planets, click the "Analyze Kundali" button to see the results.

## Project Structure

-   `index.html`: The main HTML file that provides the structure of the website.
